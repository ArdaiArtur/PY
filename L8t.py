import scipy.optimize as optimize

# Define the objective function to minimize
def objective_function(x):
    return x[0]**2 + x[1]**2

# Define the starting point
x0 = [1, 10]

# Minimize the objective function
res = optimize.minimize(objective_function, x0)

#In this example, we have a simple objective function defined as x[0]^2 + x[1]^2 which is a simple parabolic function with a global minimum at (0,0). We then define a starting point x0 for the optimization algorithm, and passed it to the optimize.minimize() function along with the objective function. The function returns a results object that contains the minimum value of the objective function and the values of x that minimize it.

#SciPy also provides other optimization functions like optimize.minimize_scalar(), optimize.minimize_tnc() or optimize.minimize_slsqp() for different optimization problems.

#Additionally, you can use the scipy library for solving other problems like optimization, signal processing, interpolation, integration, optimization, image processing, cluster and more.
