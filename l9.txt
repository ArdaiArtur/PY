There are many libraries and frameworks for machine learning in Python, such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, to name 
a few.

Here's an example of how you can use the scikit-learn library to train a simple linear regression model on some sample
 data:

In this example, we use the make_regression() function from sklearn.datasets to generate a sample data for regression. 
The generated data is then split into training and test sets using the train_test_split() function. Next, we create an instance 
of the LinearRegression model, and we train the model on the training data using the fit() method. Finally, we evaluate the performance
 of the model on the test data using the score() method and print the coefficient of determination R^2.

scikit-learn library provides many other machine learning models like LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, 
RandomForestClassifier, KMeans, and more. You can also use scikit-learn for pre-processing and feature extraction steps before
 applying the machine learning models.

Please let me know if you have any more questions about machine learning in Python, or if you would like to see examples of 
using other libraries or frameworks.
